Java Notes:

- button to select 2 player or one player mode (taco master) - either toggle or radio button
- 1 player plays against computer, can computer return random result?
- player one defaults to X value, player two or computer defaults to O value
- define winning strategies, and display a you win taco

Bonus Goals:

- keep track of 3 moves in a row for a winner
- can you keep track of wins per session (maybe an event listener for how long?)


Design Notes:

- game board needs to scaled for small media
- font size needs to scale at different media query size
- Taco displays when someone wins. ?!
